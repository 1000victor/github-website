[//LICENSE REASON//]
[I chose MIT because it is much shorter to read and fits this project the most. I'm not exactly worried about derrivative creations and this repo is basically just me messing around with github's options. At the very least I think its a good insight of what I currently know about HTML.]
[//OVERVIEW//] 
[This site is just random nonsense gotten from an AI with my poor attempt at web design. I am aware my pull requests don't follow the issue convention... Oh well, its to be expected when the instructions are written out of order. Some people just don't have enough time to casually read all the way to the end.]
